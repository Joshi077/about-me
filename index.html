            A committed learner with in-depth expertise in a variety of
            marketing and business-related subjects. Studying for a master's in
            digital marketing and channel management at the University of
            Surrey. This curriculum will be extremely helpful for me in
            achieving my objective of contributing to, adding to, and growing my
            family's business.

            The gainful utilisation of time is instilled by my family. I grew up
            watching my parents work tirelessly to launch and grow the business.
            During my bachelor's , as a part-time apprentice under him, I gained
            first-hand knowledge about everything a business owner needs to
            know. In the future, I aspire to honour the efforts of my parents by
            scaling this business up to a level we can all be proud of. I hope
            to be someone trusted to bring solutions backed by solid scrutiny
            and a fresh perspective.

              My bachelorâ€™s in business administration with a first-class
              distinction ensured a solid theoretical foundation. Through the
              three years, I also doused myself with projects and case studies
              to gain first-hand experience of analytical methods and critical
              thinking. With the help of summer internships I gained experience
              about the market which made my marketing base stronger.

              I can see several ways to improve some of the cultural norms and
              business codes. First, I see scope to help teams move beyond their
              habitual thinking blocks and inspire them to imagine alternate
              possibilities. My goal will be to end all assumptions and invite
              new thinking. Second, I will use the techniques I learn here to
              infuse empathy for the end user into the employees. A culture of
              walking in their shoes and experiencing their pain points will
              help the organisation come up with apt changes. Third, I will be
              better equipped to recognise the promising ideas that flutter into
              my mind or life.
